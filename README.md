# PPG_Tools

Tools and scripts for analysing and visualizing PPG (photoplethysmogram) signals. 

For my experiments I am aquiring data from a MAX30102 [1] sensor mounted on GY-MAX30102 [2] breakout board. Firmware to stream data to UART is available [here](https://github.com/jdesbonnet/LPC824_MAX30102).
